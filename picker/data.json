    "bio": "David Bowie was born in South London's Brixton neighborhood on January 8, 1947. His first hit was the song 'Space Oddity' in 1969. The original pop chameleon, Bowie became a fantastical sci-fi character for his breakout Ziggy Stardust album. He later co-wrote 'Fame' with Carlos Alomar and John Lennon which became his first American No. 1 single in 1975. An accomplished actor, Bowie starred in The Man Who Fell to Earth in 1976. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.",
